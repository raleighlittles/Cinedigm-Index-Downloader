Factory	IFC (No Redbox or Netflix)				DVD Single		genre: Thriller		English	English	NR	2017	"Matthew Gray Bubler, AnnaLynne MCCord, Alisha Boe"	Trent Haaga	"Inderpal Singh, Stephanie Trepanier"	"Trailer-dwelling, sewage-pumping Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler) may not lead the most glamorous life, but he’s got one thing going for him: he’s head over heels infatuated with his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord). He’s more than willing to overlook her wild streak—the fact that she’s hooking up with their landlord; her rather extreme mood swings —so when she proposes a plot to steal $68,000, he goes along with the plan. But when what was supposed to be a simple heist turns into an off-the-rails, blood-spattered crime spree, Chip learns the hard way just how deranged the love of his life really is. The new film from Troma alum Trent Haaga blends wicked comedy with pure pulp thrills for a no-holds-barred blast of insanity."	http://www.newvideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/68Kill.DVD.Cover.300dpi.jpg					SF18291	8.26663E+11	22.97	1/2/2018	11/21/2017	2-disc set (Blu-Ray; DVD)	93 min	1.78:1
