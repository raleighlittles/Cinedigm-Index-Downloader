Indie Rights,CEG10019190,The Final Project,2015,"For six college students, it’s the ultimate graduation project: A documentary about one of the most notorious haunted sites in the Southern United States. Lafitte Plantation is a Civil War landmark with a dark past steeped in American history. All over Vacherie, Louisiana, locals whisper about the legend of Lafitte, telling terrifying stories of dead soldiers, murdered families, and restless shadows roaming its abandoned corridors. No one has occupied Lafitte in years. No one will stay after dark. No one has dared to uncover its secrets… until now.
Outfitted with high-tech recording equipment, the intrepid filmmakers are ready for anything. Venturing deep into the Louisiana backwoods with cameras ready and GoPro ‘head-cams’ online, the students begin to explore the estate and plantation grounds, live-streaming every moment of their adventure. But something is watching, and one of them has already been chosen. As darkness falls and their fears come to life, one by one, they’ll learn the terrible secret of Lafitte. The dead are awake, and there are some places the living should never go.
The Final Project is the dark brainchild of Louisiana-based director Taylor Ri’chard and screenwriter Zach Davis. Utilizing real locations in and around Georgia, it features a crew and ensemble of dedicated locals well acquainted with the haunted history of the South. Combining the “found footage” genre with authentic local folklore, it updates the classic American ghost story by tapping into a history too chilling to deny.
The backstory of The Final Project boasts both an Old Hollywood touch and a real-life twist. Chretien Point Plantation in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, the real-life model for the film’s Lafitte Plantation, was also the inspiration for the interior of the legendary “Tara” from Gone with the Wind.

The two share a love of literature, quoting the classics to each other, and enjoying the dream life of up-and-coming academics with a bright future ahead of them.

But after Roy unexpectedly proposes, Calliope is beset by a sudden series of unexplained seizures that unlock memories of her long-buried past as a teenage runaway—a past defined by violence, sex, and emotional manipulation by a mysterious man named Billy.

Billy is an enigma — a pathological liar and self-proclaimed Vietnam vet who made his living selling junk at flea markets. Teenage Calliope found herself drawn to him for reasons she could not explain. In an effort to escape her abusive mother and largely absent father, she found herself falling into his twisted world. She was nearly consumed by it, barely escaping with her life.

Now, as the seizures increase in intensity and the memories of her time with Billy begin to intrude upon the reality of her ordered life, she finds herself compelled to seek answers — and to confront the man who brought her so much pain.

But as Calliope journeys deeper and deeper into the vagaries of her past, the hard lines of her current reality become porous and blurred. Past and present collide, sending Calliope into a spiral from which she may not emerge.

Suffused with both the emotional naturalism of Mike Leigh and the psycho-sexual surrealism of David Lynch, 'Dead Billy' is a deeply disturbing psychological thriller, an intense drama of faith and identity, and a raw and brutal love story that provides more questions than answers. It is a look at one woman’s search for her own truth — and an examination of how that truth may lead her into madness.",90 minutes,21-Mar-17,Scotty Milder,"Marlo Marquise, Matt Page, Gordon Clapp, John Hardy, Lauren Myers","Genre: Drama, Suspension, burlesque, S&M, goth, rock, nudity, sex, blood, psychological thriller, thriller, literature, seizure, fire-breathing, piercings, whips, horror, drama, noir, romance, dark romance, arthouse, avant-garde, indie, edgy, gritty, dark,",CEG10019762_DeadBilly_XBox_1168x1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have been fighting against vanishing coastlines for years with mixed results; often having no choice but to abandon properties and move buildings. Adding to this conversation are the conservationists and scientists who feel the coastlines should be left alone for a multitude of different reasons.

Should we use new technologies to preserve these areas for human use, or should we allow nature to take its course? Is there a balance to be struck between nature and technology, a solution fair and agreeable to all sides?

Cinema Libre Studios,CEG10019777,The Best Democracy Money Can Buy,2016,"When Donald Trump says, ""This election is rigged""—he should know.  His buddies are rigging it.  
Rolling Stone investigative reporter Greg Palast busted Jeb Bush for stealing the 2000 election by purging Black voters from Florida’s electoral rolls. Now Palast is back to take a deep dive into the Republicans’ dark operation, Crosscheck, designed to steal a million votes by November.

Crosscheck is controlled by a Trump henchman, Kris Kobach, Kansas Secretary of State who claims his computer program has identified 7.2 million people in 29 states who may have voted twice in the same election--a felony crime.  The catch? Most of these “suspects” are minorities—in other words, mainly Democratic voters. Yet the lists and the evidence remain “confidential”.

Palast and his investigative side-kick Badpenny do what it takes to get their hands on the data, analyze it and go find some of these 7.2 million Americans tagged “suspects” and “potential duplicate voters” whose votes are threatened this November.

They hunt down and confront Kobach with the evidence of his ""lynching by laptop.""  Then they are off to find the billionaires behind this voting scam.  The search takes Palast from Kansas to the Arctic, the Congo, and to a swanky Hamptons dinner party held by Trump’s sugar-daddy, John Paulson, a.k.a. ""JP The Foreclosure King.""  Palast and Badpenny stake out top GOP donors, the billionaire known as ""The Vulture"" and the Koch brothers, whom Palast nails with a damning tape recording.

This real life detective story is told in a film noir style with cartoon animations, secret documents, hidden cameras, and a little help from Law & Order: Special Victims Unit detectives, Ice-T and Richard Belzer, Shailene Woodley, Rosario Dawson, Willie Nelson and Ed Asner, Palast and his associates expose the darkest plans of the uber-rich to steal America’s democracy.",111 minutes,24-Jan-17,Greg Palast,"Shailene Woodley, Willie Nelson, Ed Asner, Rosario Dawson, Greg Palast","Genre: Documentary, republicans, voting, corruption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
